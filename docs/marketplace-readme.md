## **Why This Project Was Created**

When working on complex projects, explaining the structure of your directories and files can be a tedious and error-prone task. This tool was created to streamline the process by automating the creation of a **text-based snapshot** of your project's structure, making it easy to:
- Upload the structure to **ChatGPT** for analysis or suggestions.
- Share project layouts with team members or collaborators.
- Quickly debug issues by providing an organized view of your project's structure.

This tool helps you focus on what really matters‚Äîcoding and solving problems‚Äîwhile taking care of tedious documentation for you. üöÄ
